Welcome to my GitHub. I've been dabbling in software development for the last few years but have only began seriously pursuing it since early 2022. Over this period I've made myself skilled with languages such as Python, Java, and R. I've become familiar with Agile, Tableau, as well as Git and GitHub. 

I'm constantly improving on my abilities and am an aspiring software developer with a few programs under my belt already. I welcome the coming changes moving forward and aspire to become a Scrum Master in the next 5 years.
